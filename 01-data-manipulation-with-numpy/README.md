# Introduction

### **1. NumPy Arrays**

[NumPy Arrays](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/01-NumPy-Arrays.md)

- What it is: Arrays are like lists but faster and smarter.
- What you do: Make arrays, see their shape (rows & columns), change their shape, flatten them, or rotate them.

---

### **2. NumPy Basics**

[NumPy Basics](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/02-NumPy-Basics.md)

- What it is: The simple stuff to get started with arrays.
- What you do: Access elements, pick parts of arrays (slices), do simple math on arrays, and play with 1D or 2D arrays.

---

### **3. Math**

[Math](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/03-Math.md)

- What it is: Doing math with arrays.
- What you do: Add, subtract, multiply, divide arrays. Use `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, etc. No loops needed—NumPy does it fast.

---

### **4. Random**

[**Random**](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/04-Random.md)

- What it is: Making random numbers.
- What you do: Create random numbers in a range, random choices, random normal or uniform numbers, or random points for testing.

---

### **5. Indexing**

[Indexing](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/05-Indexing.md)

- What it is: Picking certain elements from arrays.
- What you do: Get a single number, a row, a column, a block of numbers. Find positions of min and max numbers.

---

### **6. Filtering**

[Filtering](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/06-filtering.md)

- What it is: Picking elements based on a rule.
- What you do: Get only numbers bigger than 0, replace negative numbers, or flip values using true/false conditions.

---

### **7. Statistics**

[Statistics](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/07-statistics.md)

- What it is: Finding numbers that describe your array.
- What you do: Find the smallest, biggest, average, middle number, or variance of your array (how spread out numbers are).

---

### **8. Aggregation**

[Aggregation](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/08-aggregation.md)

- What it is: Combining or summarizing arrays.
- What you do: Add all numbers, get sums of rows or columns, cumulative sums (like running total), or join arrays together.

---

### **9. Saving and Loading Data**

[Saving Data](/01-data-manipulation-with-numpy/09-saving-loading-data.md)

- What it is: Keep your arrays for later.
- What you do: Save arrays to a file and load them again so you don’t have to recreate them every time.
